      <h2>Why Madrid?</h2>
      <h3>Madrid, the sunniest capital in Europe</h3>
      <p>Although the competition with Lisbon and Athens for this position is fierce, Madrid enjoys 
        250 days without clouds on average a year. Vitamin D for everyone!
        y one of the greenest cities you can visit. Over 300,000 trees and 6400 hectares of green space 
        for you to explore, and enjoy.ed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem 
        Madrid’s fun fact is that Restaurante Botin, which was founded in 1725, is the oldest 
        continuously operated restaurant in the world. 
        Mystery surrounds the name, but legend suggests that Madrid was once called Ursaria. Because 
        of the number of bears that inhabited the region. Some believe it comes from a Roman settlement, “Matrice’ or is it “Magerit’ from the Arabic meaning ‘place of water’?
