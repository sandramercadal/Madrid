      <h2>Why Madrid?</h2>
      <h3>Madrid, the city of XYZ</h3>
      <p>The legend has it that Lisbon was named Olissipo by the Romans, 
      for its resemblance to the Roman capital. Just like Rome, Lisbon began its life 
      as a humble settlement nestled among seven hills. However, it wasn't until the 
      17th century, in the writing of Frey Nicolao d'Oliveira, that Lisbon came to be 
      called 'a cidade das sete colinas' - the city of seven hills. You can still see 
      traces of ancient Lisbon today. Beyond the array of shops with international brands, 
      peaceful streetside cafes selling the iconic pastel de nata and world class restaurants 
      with a variety of global cuisine, you can still wander the seven hills and see the city 
      from above, taking in the rolling terracotta rooftops, the whitewashed walls and on 
      the horizon, the soft blue sea.</p>
